    <h1>The CSS Flexbox layout Model</h1>
    <P>flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column.</P>

     <h1>The CSS Grid Layout Model.</h1>
     <p>Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.</p>

     <h2>When to use which One Flex model or Grid Model in CSS</h2>
     <p>No i will not choose to use one over the other but in some cases i will choose as follows.<br>
        If you are using flexbox and find yourself disabling some of the flexibility, you probably need to use CSS Grid Layout.<br> An example would be if you are setting a percentage width on a flex item to make it line up with other items in a row above. In that case, a grid is likely to be a better choice</p>
