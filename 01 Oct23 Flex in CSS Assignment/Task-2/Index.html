    <h1>The role  key properties in the Flexbox layout Model</h1>
    <h2>Justify-content</h2>
    <P>The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.</P>

    <h2>align-items</h2>
    <p>The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or grid container. In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite of flex-direction).</p>

    <h2>Gap</h2>
    <p>The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. It is a shorthand for the following properties: row-gap. column-gap.</p>

    <h2>flex-direction</h2>
    <p>The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items. Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect.</p>

    <h2>flex-wrap</h2>
    <p>The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked.</p>
